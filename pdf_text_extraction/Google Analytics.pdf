                                   Disappearing Data
• From Boston Globe (Preserving Movies)
   – “By one back-of the-envelope estimate, the number of digital photos we snap in two minutes exceeds all
     the photographs taken during the entire 19th century.”
   – “Tucked away in temperature-controlled vaults, master reels of classics like “Dr. Strangelove” and “Star
     Wars” have a high chance of surviving for hundreds of years.”
   – “But now that filmmaking has gone digital, a new threat to cinema history has surfaced. Preserving digital
     artifacts.”
   – “The cloud isn’t yet robust enough for long-term archival of complex datasets and gigantic master movie
     files.”
   – “The problem of preservation is not unique to the film industry. From scientific papers published up to 80%
     of raw data collected for studies in the early 1990s is lost.”
   – “Lost data also plagues the legal world.”
                                     Disappearing Data
• “Not everything is worth saving for the long haul.”
• “Even if we could save all data in the cloud, we would have to invest in annotating data to create searchable
  archives that save useful knowledge for people in the future.”
• “Saving scientific data poses similar economic challenges.”

                              Review of Used Terms
Terms used:
• Page - a web document (HTML, text, video files etc.), excludes image files (hits).
• PageView - a page loaded by a browser when a visitor types the URL. GA logs a pageview each time
   the tracking code is executed.
• Pages/visit - Number of web pages viewed in a particular visit.
• Bounce - Single page viewed by the visitor who leaves promptly.
• Average Time on Site – Duration of site visit.
• New Visits – page accessed for the first time by a web browser (GA identification by the web
   browser. By setting a cookie).
                                             Keywords Used
• Loyalty (visitor behavior): Loyal visitors are frequently highly engaged with your brand, and a high number of visits
  indicates good customer/visitor retention. A high number of new visitors indicates strong visitor recruitment.
• Recency (visitor behavior): The frequency with which visitors return to your site can indicate their level of engagement
  with your brand and their readiness to buy.
• Length of Visit (visitor behavior): Length of visit is a measure of visit quality. A large number of lengthy visits suggests
  that visitors have interacted more extensively with your site. The graph allows you to visualize the entire distribution of
  visits instead of simply the average time on site taken from all visits. Keep in mind that the average time on site is
  skewed by visitors leaving browser windows open when they are not actually viewing or using your site. You can see
  whether a few visits are skewing the average time on site upward or whether most visits to your site have a long
  average time.
• Depth of Visit (visitor behavior): Depth of visit is a measure of visit quality. A large average number of pageviews per
  visit suggests that visitors interact extensively with your site. The graph allows you to visualize the entire distribution of
  visits instead of simply the average pageviews per visit. You can see whether a few visits are skewing your average
  upward or whether most visits to your site result in a high number of pages being viewed.
• Browsers (browser capabilities): Which browsers do your visitors use? Optimizing your site with the appropriate
  technical capabilities helps make your site more engaging and usable and can result in higher conversion rates and
  more sales.
                                       Web Analytics
• Collecting relevant raw web data .
• Understand significance contained in the data.
• Analysis is used for understanding and optimizing the web usage.
• Also measuring web traffic can be used as a tool for business and market research.
• Two categories of web analytics
   – Off-site web analytics measures on data gathered from sites other than your own (Internet as a
      whole) and measures potential website audience, including social media.
        • Used to understand how to market your site by identifying the keywords tagged to your site,
           either from social media or from other websites.
   – On-site web analytics measure the actual visitor traffic arriving on your website such as
        • Performance of your website in a commercial context
        • Web page associated with online purchases
        • Audience response to your marketing campaign
                                    Log Files vs. Page Tagging
•   Two unique on-site methodologies used by analytics tools to collect web visitor-analytics data.
     1. Log files approach
     2. Page tags approach
 1. Log files approach (server-side data-collection methodology)
      – All requests for web pages, images, PDFs made to your web server are captured.
      – Data is collected by your web server and is independent of a visitor's browser.
      – Advantages of log file approach is that it is not affected by firewalls or software that can block page
         tags. Also it can differentiate between a complete download and a partial download.
 2. Page tags approach
     –  Motivation to perform web analytics as an outsourced service + corrects the accuracy of log file.
     –  Involves the tagging of the web pages with special JavaScript.
     –  A remote server captures all the tagged pages and will report the analytics to you.
     –  Google Analytics uses this approach to collect web visitor-analytics data.
                                          Google Analytics
• Standard (and free) tool for generating web analytics reports.
• It uses a page-tag approach for capturing analytics data,
    – Special JavaScript needs to be installed (tagged) in each web pages.
• It provides the means to track traffic, analyze it, and report useful metrics, such as site visits,
  marketing goals achieved, ad revenues generated etc.
• It is used in organizations of all sizes.
• You can install Google Analytics on a personal website and begin using it
    – to track visitors
    – create goals
    – measure success
                  Introduction to Google Analytics
• Google Analytics is a page-tag approach to capturing analytics data.
• Free tool that has the following functional uses:
   – Identify visitors or groups of visitors that became customers.
   – See which pages drive the most pageviews on your site. The Top Content report can answer
      questions you have about your most or least effective pages.
   – Review data for online advertising campaigns by tracking landing-page quality and conversions
      (goals), and pick out your best-performing ads.
   – Grant other people in your company or organization designing or viewing access to reports. You
      can also authorize an entire account, with administrator privileges, for anyone you want.
   – See live analytics as customers are interacting with your web site.
   – Study the location your visitors are coming from and what devices they are using (e.g.,
      smartphones or desktops).
   – Leverage more than 80 reports with customizable templates.
                    Introduction to Google Analytics
• Examples of Google Analytics metrics:
   – Daily visitors to your site
   – Average conversion rate
   – Top visited pages
   – Average visit time on the web site
   – How often visitors come back
   – Average visit’s page depth
   – Geographic distribution of visitors
   – Bounce rate
• As part of a Assignment project you will need to
   – Create and use a Goggle web site.
   – Set up Google Analytics on your web site.
   – Present your analytics
             How Does Google Analytics Work?
• Data about visitors is collected from desktop computers and devices and stored in
  large Google company databases.
• When we log into Google Analytics, we open up such a reporting database and
  review the analytics data collected.
• This process does not involve the active participation of the web server that hosts
  the web site.
• Depending on how much traffic you have, there will inevitably be some variance in
  how long it takes from the time a visitor views a web page on your company server
  to when Google reports the analytics data.
              How Does Google Analytics Work?
• According to Google, there are four main components to the Google Analytics
  system:
   – data collection,
   – configuration,
   – data processing, and
   – reporting.
                   How Does Google Analytics Work?
Collection
    – You can collect data from any digitally connected environment, including a kiosk or a point-of-sale (POS)
       system.
    – To track a web site, Google Analytics uses a small piece of JavaScript code, which tracks user engagement.
    – You must place this piece of code on every page of the web site.
    – When a user arrives at your web site, this JavaScript code will collect various pieces of information about
       how the user engages with your site. This process will be introduced in the next section.
Processing
    – JavaScript collects information about the web site, the browser or device, and the referring source and sends
       it to the Google servers for processing.
    – This is the “transformation” step in which the raw data becomes useful information.
    – For example, during data processing, Google Analytics will categorize users' devices as mobile or non mobile.
                 How Does Google Analytics Work?
Configuration
   – In this step, Google Analytics applies any configuration settings you have identified to the raw data.
   – For example, you may have used a filter to exclude data from your own internal users, as such data would
      produce inflated results.
   – Once the data is processed, it is inserted into Google’s analytics database. Such recording of data is
      permanent and can’t be changed
Reporting
   – The last component of the Google Analytics platform is reporting.
   – A simple-to-use web interface found at www.google.com/analytics makes it possible to retrieve data from
      your organization’s Google Analytics account.
                    Defining Basic Analytics Metrics
• In analytics it is essential to know which numbers are important and why.
• Note that the metric focuses on “Why”.
• Basic Analytics Metrics
   1.  Visits and Visitor Sessions
   2.  Referrals
   3.  Bounce & Exit Rate
   4.  Conversion Rate
   5.  Engagement
   6.  SEO, Social Media, Emails and Metrics
                            1. Visits and Visitor Sessions
• Visitor - an individual (not necessarily a human) or device such as browser which accesses a
  Web site within a specific time period.
   •   Unique visitor within a specific reporting period (no double counting).
• Visit (Sessions) – an interaction with a data source (examp: text and/or graphics downloads)
  from a single browser (device) during a single session.
    –   A visit can consist of a series of page views that a single visitor makes during a period of browsing
       activity. A visit ends after the visitor closes the browser, clears cookies, or is inactive for 30 minutes
       (customizable time period).
    –  During each visit, users will engage in one or more interactions with the web site pages.
    –  Analytics software will automatically track these interactions as “pageviews.” The pageview metric
       increases every time a page is viewed on your site. Other activity, like watching a video, mouse
       position, etc. can also be tracked. Such activities are better classified as “events” rather than
       pageviews.
    –  Cookie (persistent or session) is a file on the user’s device that identifies the user’s unique browser.
    –  Tracking code looks for cookies. If a cookie is deleted or blocked
       incorrectly counts unique visitors.
            2. Referrals - Where do visitors come from?
• Referrals indicate the place from which the user clicked to get to the current page.
• It is a valuable to know how someone found our web site. Was it
    –   through a search engine
    –   positive review
    –   social-media talk
    –   email or e-newsletters
• Referrals are the lifeline for marketing advertisements.
• It's important to know which campaigns helped draw in new visitors or succeeded in getting loyal customers.
                                 3. Bounce and Exit Rate
• Bounce rate and the exit rate measure whether users find a web site or a web page useful.
• Bounces are counted for users who land on a page and leave immediately. They do not see the page content.
• Reasons can be site-design or usability issues or many other reasons.
• Typically expressed as percentage of single-page sessions.
• If the exit rate is high, the exit-rate metric can be meaningless, and it should not matter.
• Useful to find out if visitors are abandoning the site at a certain point in the middle of an e-commerce
  transaction.
                                 4. Conversion Rate
• In the context of studying goals and outcomes, this metrics is a significant one.
• The conversion rate (as a percentage), is defined as
                             conversion rate = outcome/unique visits * 100
• An example of an outcome could be something very simple like clicking on ads or coupons or
  subscribing to a newsletter.
• Should we use Unique Visitors (browsers) or Visits?
• Common for a unique visitor to visit the same page many times (purchase).
• In this context conversion rate measures the process of converting a visitor into a buyer.
• Conversion rate can be calculated automatically by integrating analytics software with shopping
  carts.
                                       5. Engagement
• This is a qualitative metric hard to measure. The definition can be fuzzy.
• Most analytics software will track event and visit duration.
• This does not provide any information about the quality of engagement.
• What it matters is the time a visitor spends on a web site with engagement.
• The challenge is to distinguish between
   – Reading the information on a web page or
   – Looking for the information and not being able to find it.
• Example: Google Analytics tools allow us to research engagement
   – In-Page Analytics (visual assessment of how users interact with your web pages)
   – Behavior Flow analytics (visualizes the path users traveled from one page or event to the next).
• Both of these contribute to Engagement statistics.
• More on Google Analytics in the next module.
 Donald Trump Organization (Dana McDonough)
                          • I did my website on Donald
                            Trump in hopes to receive a
                            significant amount of traffic
                            at my site
                          • The site consists of a Home

                Regarding Google Analytics Assignment
• For the Google Analytics Assignment you can create a
   – Goggle web site
   – or you can choose to create the website somewhere else (Dropbox, OneDrive, etc.).
• Simple enough web site (not a big project) but to fulfill the assignment requirements.
• Also you would need time to build access statistics, as a suggestion share the websites among each
  other so you can have variety of access statistics and try to use different devices.
• Considering that it takes 24 hours for the analytics to work, and your mutual involvement building
  this analytics, let’s try to finish Google Analytics Assignment at the same time.
                     Create a test Goggle web site
• Here is an illustration of a simple
  web site
   – containing only a “Hello!“ index page and
   – a link to a “Documents” page containing
   – a pdf file ready for download.
• Go to: sites.google.com click
  “Create” and name your page.
   – Click on the newly created site
   – Click on the “Pen” tool to edit your index
     page
   – Add some text that later you are going to
     link to the other page
                    Create a test Goggle web site
• Use “Create Page” to add the
  “Documents” page.
   – Add some text
   – Click “ADD FILES” to add a PDF file
   – Add some PDF file from your computer
                 Create a test Goggle web site
• Add a link from the index “Hello!”
  page to the “Documents” page.
   – Use the “Add or Remove Link” tool
 Note
• Google Analytics will not track how
  many times people download PDFs or
  other file types.
• For your assignment,
   – either avoid a download as a goal that
     you would monitor
   – or figure out the ways around it as
     described online.
 Create a new Analytics Account for your web site
• A good step by step explanation: https://support.google.com/sites/answer/97459?hl=en
• In your Google Analytics account select the Admin tab. Create a new Analytics account (for each of your
  sites).
• Account Name: Choose what you want to call this account.
• Website Name: Choose what you want to call the website you're tracking.
• Website URL: Enter the URL for the site you're tracking (the one you have just created).
• Click Get Tracking ID ("UA-XXXXXXXX-X" ).
                       Configure Google Analytics
                                   to your web site
Two slightly different steps:
1. Configure Google Analytics for Google Sites.
    – You just need to add the Tracking ID ("UA-XXXXXXXX-X") to your Google web site.
    – Google web site will automatically place it on all of your pages on your Google web site.
2. Configure Google Analytics to any other web site.
    – You need to paste (by hand) the JavaScript code into every webpage you want to track on your web site.
   1. Configure Google Analytics for Google Sites
• After you create your new Google Analytics
  account, you will be directed to you Google
  Analytics profile screen, where the name of
  your tracked site should appear, followed by a
  Google Analytics account number in the format,
  'UA-XXXXXXXX-X' Copy this code - known as
  your Analytics Web Property ID - and go to the
  site that you want to track with Google
  Analytics.
• On your site, click the Settings icon in the top-
  right and select Manage Site.
  1. Configure Google Analytics for Google Sites
• Under the Site Settings section, click General.
• Click the drop-down menu below "Statistics"
  and switch to Use Google Analytics.
• Enter your Analytics Web Property ID (UA-
  XXXXXXXX-X) in the associated box.
• Click "Save“ changes.
• In 24 hours or less the Google analytics for
  your Google web site will work.
 2. Configure Google Analytics for any other web
                                             site
• I’ll illustrate by creating the same web site on Dropbox.
   – containing only a “Hello!“ index page and
   – a link to a “Documents” page containing
   – a pdf file ready for download.
                          Create a web site
• I used a text editor to create the simple
    – index page with a link to
    – the “Documents” page with a link to
    – a pdf file ready for download
• All of these 3 files (index.html, pdfdocuments.html and tm.pdf) are in the same folder!
                             Get the JavaScript code
• From Google analytics page
   – Select the Analytics account you want to use (Assignment 2)
   – Click Tracking Info/Tracking Code
   – Copy the JavaScript code
     Insert the JavaScript code in your web pages
• Paste the Google Analytics JavaScript code snippet into the bottom of the content, immediately before the
  "</body>" tag on every page on the site you want to track.
• In 24 hours or less the Google analytics of your web site will work.

                        GA Assignment Suggestions
• Design your web site to be just complex enough so you can answer the requirements of Assignment.
   – Create a specific goal (or goals) , so you can describe the goal funnels.
   – The idea behind manual or auto tagging is to bring in new website visitors and minimize bounce rates by
     tailoring landing pages to each keyword.
   – Regarding e-commerce you can consider the click button that you place on your website for download to be
     books or any other item that you may sell. Of cause do not place documents of importance containing
     information that you would not like to share. Depending on the topic you choose just within hours or days
     your web site will be visited by large number of people from everywhere.
                                          GA Assignment
