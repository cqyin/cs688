My Background
•

•
•

•

PhD. in physics from Tufts University working with David Weaver and Martin Karplus on computational

Please Introduce Yourself
•

Introduce yourself to me and the other students

•

Tell us about your background, your interests, hobbies, etc., so that we can get to know each other better.

•

Please describe two or three objectives you hope to accomplish by the end of the course, e.g.
– How does this course fit into your academic and professional objectives;
– What do you hope to gain from the course.

•

Please describe the type of data you work with and what pattern you typically look for in it.

Introduction
•

Most of the information we use today is stored online. There are claims that the data generated over the
last 2 years is few fold larger than the data generated previously in the history of mankind.

•

Most of this newly generated data is text, images and videos in a form of email, Google, YouTube,
Facebook, Twitter, blogs, and most of the other technologies that define our digital age. To this we
should also add the new communication tools such as social networks, instant messaging, Yammer,
Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn etc. too.

•

By some general estimates a third of our time is spent on searching for information and another quarter
analyzing it. It is widely believed that more and more data will be generated in the near future (IoT) and
the time managing this data must be as productive as possible.

•

This is just one aspect of what this course is about! We have an exciting journey ahead as we acquire the
skills regarding this subject step-by-step.

Examples of Web analytics use
Web analytics is commonly used to give:
• Real-time visibility into web site performance,
• Order status,

• Inventory levels,
• Warehouse management systems.

Data Analytics
• Real data are often in
high dimensions with
multiple aspects
(modes)
• Matrices and tensors
provide elegant theory
and algorithms

Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

SVD and Text Mining
• https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_analysis

A is document term [mxn] matrix (m rows, n columns).
ATA is term to term similarity [mxm] matrix.
AAT is document to document similarity [nxn] matrix.

Time Series Data
• Dynamical (streaming) data such as in IoT
– A sequence of Mth order tesnsors.

Introduction: Working with data
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Lots of digital data generated over the last few years with expectations that more and more data will be
generated in the near future.
Questions arise how to optimally manage it in less time.
Typically at some point all this unstructured data is reduced to digital text as most practical form.
Analytics - discovery of relevant patterns in data.
Mining - extracting useful information from data.
Either way the goal is to learn from data.
In the language of machine learning (to learn without explicitly being programmed) these learning
categorizations can be subdivided as
– Supervised learning (we know the categories into which we need to separate the data). Task: for new feature x,
predict y)
• Regression (continuous y data predictions from features x)
• Classification (discrete y data predictions from features x)
– Unsupervised learning (we don't have any knowledge into what categories the data can be subdivided ) - find
structure in large data set.
• Clustering

What is an analytic?
• Methodology of revealing a meaningful pattern in recorded information (data) to quantify a
performance.
• Relies on the simultaneous application of several steps and techniques including research and
data storage managed by a computer system.
– Database
• Typically used for large, long-lived data.

– The knowledge base data storage (called an ontology) is
•
•
•
•

A dynamic resource
An object model with classes, subclasses, and instances.
Benefits - being able to store, analyze, and reuse knowledge
Typically used to arrive at a specific answer to a problem.

• Use of computer systems to implement
– Statistics techniques
– Including machine learning

• Analytics is used to drive decision making
– By identifying which data is useful and meaningful

Components of Analytics
•

Descriptive analytics – describe what is happening in your system.
–

•

•
•
•
•
•
•

Simply describes past events and can allow for interpretation in preventing future negative impacts.

Predictive analytics – predict what could happen.
–

Utilizes a variety of statistical, modeling, data mining and machine learning techniques to study historical and recent data.

–

Allows analysts to make predictions about future (positive or negative) events.

–

Currently being able to foresee positive and negative events is extremely powerful feature used to derive marginal advantages over
competitors, if not to gain competitive advantage.

–

Predictive analytics takes into account all historical data, allowing for linking of key data points over time to provide predictive
features related to operational cost effectiveness and possible downtrends.

All this is used to prescribe solutions to help mitigate issues along the way.
This new and growing area of predictive analytics gives the probability of an event and gives the data points needed to mitigate it.
The combination of analytics and predictive analytics (coding) offers more advanced and cost-effective operation.
In addition, machine based predictive analytics capabilities can help find the meaning and subset useful data based on input from the
user.
An intuitive predictive coding workflow can validate performance and allow weighing the costs and benefits based on specific measure
thresholds (such as precision and recall).
It can recommend one or more courses of action – and show the likely outcome of each scenario.
